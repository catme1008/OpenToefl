# OpenToefl
Hi Guys
This is my own project for preparing for the TOEFL Test.

I know there are many students and programmers who are devoting themselves to preparing for this test, which is quite difficult for a non-native speaker.

I'v also heard that there are many language schools and training institutions charging an expensive fee to offer courses which are completely not deserving its cost.

I believe that we can do somthing to kill this test with sharing and the force of open-source.

Let's work together.
